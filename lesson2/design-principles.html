                <h3>The Church of Jesus Christ of Later-Day Saints</h3>

                <p>
                    The website of the Church of Jesus Christ of Later-Day Saints uses the principle of repetition given
                    that
                    there is a similar structure in each of the resources. It uses the same font and the same backround
                    colors.
                    The topics are also related, we can see 3 different images of Jesus Christ.

                <img src="./images/union.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of Union Website">
                <p>
                    The website of the Union club follows the principle of white space and clean design since its images and
                    paragraphs have appropiate padding. There is a distance between each other. This is found in all of the
                    subpages, despite the screenshot was taken in the main page.

                <p>
                    The website of National Geographic reflects clearly the principle of contrast. Althought it may seem a
                    a bit dark, it uses few colors but attractive colors. Many film and television websites are dark
                    environments,
                    since the mind associates it with the darkness of the cinema.
