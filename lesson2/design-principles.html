            <p>
                The website of the Church of Jesus Christ of Later-Day Saints uses the principle of repetition given that 
                there is a similar structure in each of the resources. It uses the same font and the same backround colors.
                The topics are also related, we can see 3 different images of Jesus Christ.

            <p>
                The website of the Union club follows the principle of white space and clean design since its images and
                paragraphs have appropiate padding. There is a distance between each other. This is found in all of the 
                subpages, despite the screenshot was taken in the main page.

            <p>
                The website of National Geographic reflects clearly the principle of contrast. Althought it may seem a
                a bit dark, it uses few colors but attractive colors. Many film and television websites are dark environments,
                since the mind associates it with the darkness of the cinema.
